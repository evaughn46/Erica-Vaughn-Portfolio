# Erica Vaughn — Tailwind Portfolio (Editable)

This is a fully editable, Tailwind-based portfolio with:
- `index.html` (hero, about w/ LinkedIn blog, projects, skills, contact)
- `case-studies/case-databricks.html` (Microsoft-first framing: Synapse Link + Databricks)
- `case-studies/case-demand-planner.html` (Power Pages tool on Blue Yonder baseline)
- `assets/Erica_Vaughn_Resume.pdf` (replace if needed)
- `assets/screenshots/` (drop your PNG/JPG screenshots and update the <img> tags)
- `script.js` (smooth scroll, mobile menu, footer year)

## Edit
Open the HTML files in VS Code and change copy/links. Tailwind is loaded via CDN for simplicity.

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push this folder, then Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (root).
- Netlify: drag-and-drop folder to the dashboard.
- Azure Static Web Apps: create a static app, point to this repo, output = `/`.
